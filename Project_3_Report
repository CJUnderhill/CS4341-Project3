Set of Experiments Performed

We experimented first with no layers added to what was initially given, one hidden layer and the output layer.
We changed the batch size, number of epochs, activation function, and ???weight initialization scheme.
The batch sizes we tried were 512, 256, 64, and 32. The accuracies were... the other variables were at...
We tried changing the activation functions from relu to tanh and selu. Relu worked the best for...
We also tried changin the number of epochs from 100 to 50 and 200???
We tried adding several layers with 512, 196, 49 nodes...


Model & Training Procedure Description

The most accurate model we were able to obtain was using:
model structure
# of layers
# of neurons in each layer
weight initialization scheme
activation function
# of epochs for training
batch size for training
